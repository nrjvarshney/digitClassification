model.summary()


# ## output of every Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layer is a 3D tensor of shape (height, width, channels)
# 
# ## The width and height dimensions tend to shrink as you go deeper in the network
# 
# ## The number of channels is controlled by the firstargument passed to the Conv2D layers (32 or 64).
# 
# ## The next step is to feed the last output tensor (of shape (3, 3, 64) ) into a densely connected classifier network like those youâ€™re already familiar with: a stack of Dense layers.
# 
# ## These classifiers process vectors, which are 1D , whereas the current output is a 3D tensor. First we have to flatten the 3D outputs to 1D , and then add a few Dense layers on top.
